## Purpose

We found that during the debugging process, customers found that they could often report cross-domain errors or upload failures. Here we provide an oss debugging method that can quickly upload uploaded pictures and documents. **After the product is out of the testing period, be sure to pay attention to the need to change to a higher security configuration.**

## The configuration steps

1. Allow public read and write
