When the room is abnormal, you can check the room status in the demo provided by entering the corresponding `room uuid` and` roomToken` through the page provided by [Online Debugging](blog/debug-center.md).
The live room and playback room pages will expose the `room` and` player` instances to global variables, respectively.

> We also use this page for quick debugging.
